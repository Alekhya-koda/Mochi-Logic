## 2. Why Now

- Pregnancy and postpartum mental health challenges are increasingly recognized, but understanding remains fragmented and unevenly accessible.
- Emotional and psychological strain during this period is more visible, yet couples lack shared frameworks to interpret it together.
- Rising awareness has increased expectations for support, while cost, access, and stigma continue to limit effective understanding.

## 3. Core Problems

### Problem 1: Psychological Misunderstanding Between Partners
- **Description:** Partners struggle to understand the emotional and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy and postpartum, both in themselves and in each other.
- **What is broken with the status quo:** Emotional changes are often misinterpreted as personal failings, lack of care, or relationship problems.
- **Why this is a real struggle:** Misunderstanding amplifies conflict, isolation, and emotional distress during an already vulnerable period.
- **How painful it is:** High emotional stress, relationship strain, and increased mental health risk.

### Problem 2: Lack of Shared Mental Models
- **Description:** Couples lack a common language or framework to discuss emotional changes constructively.
- **Why this matters:** Without shared understanding, communication breaks down even when intentions are good.

## 4. Existing Alternatives

### Current Approaches
- Reading books or articles (often generic, overwhelming, or one-sided)
- Online searches and forums (inconsistent quality and anecdotal advice)
- Professional support (effective but costly, infrequent, or inaccessible)

### Doing Nothing
- Many couples tolerate confusion and stress, which can escalate into long-term emotional or relational damage.

### True Competition
- Informal advice from friends or family  
- Occasional professional consultations  
- Self-directed research  

These alternatives provide information but fail to create shared understanding between partners.
