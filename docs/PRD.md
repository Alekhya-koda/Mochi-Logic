# Product Requirement Document

## Overview

This PRD proposes a web-based application that helps couples during pregnancy and the postpartum period develop shared emotional understanding.

The overall vision for the product is to create a system that enables both partners to interpret emotional and psychological changes together, reducing misunderstanding, conflict, and emotional distress during a critical life transition.

---

## Goals

- Enable shared emotional understanding between partners during pregnancy and postpartum  
- Reduce misinterpretation of emotional changes as lack of care or relationship failure  
- Support individual emotional reflection in a neutral, non-judgmental environment  
- Detect early signs of depression through regular screening  
- Enable timely escalation to therapist-supported group conversations when risk is identified  
- Improve emotional clarity without providing prescriptive advice  

---

## Non-Goals

- Diagnosing or treating clinical mental health conditions  
- Replacing licensed therapy or medical care  
- Providing emergency or crisis intervention  
- Resolving deep or pre-existing relationship dysfunction  
- Offering prescriptive behavioral or relationship advice  

---

## Audience

The primary audience consists of couples during pregnancy and the postpartum period who experience emotional, psychological, or relational strain due to rapid mental and physical changes.

Most users want clarity and mutual understanding rather than judgment or conflict resolution tactics. They prefer low-friction, emotionally safe support that fits into daily life.

A secondary audience includes therapists who participate in occasional, moderated group chats when emotional risk is detected.

## Existing Solutions and Issues

While alternatives exist, each fails to support shared emotional understanding:

- **Books and articles**
  - Often generic, overwhelming, or one-sided
  - Do not align both partners around the same emotional framework

- **Online searches and forums**
  - Inconsistent quality and anecdotal advice
  - Frequently reinforce blame or misinterpretation

- **Professional therapy**
  - Effective but costly, episodic, and inaccessible
  - Typically reactive rather than preventative

- **Doing nothing**
  - Emotional confusion escalates into long-term relational damage

---

## Assumptions

- Users are familiar with pregnancy and postpartum as emotionally challenging periods  
- Many users lack affordable or consistent psychological support  
- Couples value mutual understanding more than winning arguments  
- Shared emotional understanding reduces conflict without prescriptive actions  
- Users will trust a neutral system if privacy and safety are ensured  

---

## Constraints

- The MVP is a web application  
- Each partner interacts with the system individually via private chat  
- Depression screening is conducted regularly  
- Therapist interaction is occasional and triggered, not continuous  
- All language must remain non-diagnostic and non-clinical  
- High standards for privacy, neutrality, and emotional safety are required  

---

## Key Use Cases

- Individual emotional reflection by each partner  
- Regular depression screening and monitoring  
- Interpretation of emotional changes using a shared framework  
- Detection of emotional risk or depression signals  
- Escalation to therapist-supported group chat when needed  
- Restoration of shared understanding after emotional misalignment  

---

## Individual Emotional Reflection

Each partner uses a private chat interface to reflect on emotional experiences.

The system contextualizes emotions within pregnancy and postpartum changes to reduce confusion before relational interpretation.

---

## Regular Depression Screening

The product periodically administers depression assessments to each partner.

Results are monitored over time to identify elevated emotional risk without diagnosis.

---

## Risk Detection and Escalation

When screening results indicate elevated risk, the system initiates escalation.

This enables a therapist-supported group chat involving both partners.

---

## Couple Therapy Group Chat with AI Counselor

A shared chat space allows both partners and a AI counselor to align on emotional context.

The AI counselor facilitates understanding rather than ongoing treatment.
