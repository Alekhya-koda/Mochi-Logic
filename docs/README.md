## Overview

Mochi Logic provides a web-based platform for couples experiencing emotional and psychological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period. By combining individual reflection spaces, regular mental health screening, and AI-facilitated group conversations, the system helps partners interpret emotional changes together—reducing misunderstanding and relationship strain.

##  Key Features

- **Private Individual Reflection** – Each partner has a secure, confidential chat space for emotional processing with empathetic AI guidance
- **Regular Depression Screening** – EPDS-based assessments monitor emotional well-being over time (non-diagnostic)
- **Shared Understanding Framework** – Neutral summaries help couples interpret emotional changes with a common language
- **Smart Escalation** – Risk detection triggers AI counselor-facilitated group conversations when support is needed
- **Privacy-First Design** – Private chats remain private; only consensually shared summaries enter group discussions
- **Voice Output** – Text-to-speech support for key AI responses

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
During pregnancy and postpartum, emotional changes are often misinterpreted as:
- Lack of love or effort
- Personal failure
- Relationship breakdown

This confusion amplifies conflict during an already vulnerable period, yet couples lack shared frameworks to understand these changes together.

### The Solution
Mochi Logic creates **interpretation before reaction**—helping both partners understand the same emotional reality at the same time, without diagnosis, prescription, or judgment.

## Architecture

The system operates through three integrated flows:

1. **Individual Counseling** – Private AI chat sessions with contextualized, non-judgmental prompts
2. **Screening & Monitoring** – Regular EPDS surveys with intelligent risk flagging
3. **Guided Group Conversations** – AI counselor-led couple discussions focused on present-moment alignment

## Use Cases

- First-time parents navigating emotional uncertainty
- Couples experiencing frequent conflict or disconnect during pregnancy
- Partners seeking proactive emotional support without clinical intervention
- Individuals wanting to understand their own emotional changes in a safe space

## Important Disclaimers

**This system is NOT:**
- A diagnostic or clinical treatment tool
- A replacement for professional therapy or medical care
- An emergency or crisis intervention service
- Designed to resolve deep or pre-existing relationship dysfunction

**This system IS:**
- A shared interpretive framework for emotional understanding
- A proactive support tool for emotionally challenging transitions
- A neutral, non-judgmental space for reflection and alignment

##Privacy & Safety

- All interactions use non-clinical, emotionally safe language
- Private chats remain completely confidential
- Group chats require explicit consent from both partners
- Only neutral, consensually shared summaries enter group discussions
- No prescriptive advice—output is understanding, not action plans

## Contributing

This project is currently in early development. Contribution guidelines will be added as the project matures.
